# MethodMeter [![Build Status](https://wnuqui.semaphoreci.com/badges/method_meter/branches/master.svg?style=shields)](https://wnuqui.semaphoreci.com/projects/method_meter)

`MethodMeter` is a library module that instruments **methods defined in a given object**. These methods are NOT from included or extended modules. These methods are also NOT from parent objects. By object, it means either a `class` or `module`.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'method_meter'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install method_meter

## Usage

```ruby
MethodMeter.observe Arithmeter

MethodMeter.measure!('key-1') do
  arithmeter = Arithmeter.new
  arithmeter.add 1, 3

  Arithmeter.sum 1, 3

  arithmeter = Arithmeter.new
  arithmeter.add 4, 3

  Arithmeter.sum 4, 3
end

ap MethodMeter.data
ap MethodMeter.measurement
```

## Acknowledgement

This library is based from https://github.com/change/method_profiler. This library is a bit more in terms of methods that it can observe. Also how it observe methods is completely different one than that of `method_profiler`. Please feel free to check the details in the code. :-)
